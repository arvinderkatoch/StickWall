# StickWall
A lightweight Windows background utility that automatically fetches top-viewed wallpapers from Wallhaven and sets them as your desktop background. The app runs silently in the background and lets you instantly cycle wallpapers using a global keyboard shortcut.  No UI. No browser. Just fresh wallpapers.
